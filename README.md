### How to Install and Configure GitLab Using Docker Compose

#### Introduction:

* GitLab is a powerful platform for managing Git repositories, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and DevOps workflows. 
* If you want to set up GitLab on your local machine for personal projects or team collaboration, Docker Compose offers a simple and efficient way to manage the installation.

#### Prerequisites:
